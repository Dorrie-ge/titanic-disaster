# Titanic Disaster Project

This project trains logistic regression models in **Python** and **R** to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.

This repository contains two containerized environments: one in Python and one in R that build and train logistic regression models to predict passenger survival from the Titanic disaster (April 15, 1912). Both environments are fully reproducible using Docker.
You can follow the instructions below to run both containers and reproduce the results.

## Step 1 — Clone the Repository

## Step 2 — Download the Data
You need to manually download the Kaggle Titanic dataset because it cannot be uploaded to GitHub. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

Download the following files:

train.csv

test.csv

gender_submission.csv

Move them into: titanic-disaster/src/data/

## Step 3 — Run the Python Docker Container

Build the image

docker build -t titanic-app .

Run the container

```text
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/src/data:/app/src/data" titanic-app
```
Expected Output

```text
[INFO] Loading datasets...
✅ train.csv shape: (891, 12)
✅ test.csv shape: (418, 11)

[TRAIN] Training Logistic Regression model...
[METRICS] Training Accuracy: 0.7963
[METRICS] Validation Accuracy: 0.7877
[OUTPUT] Predictions saved to src/data/predictions.csv
[DONE] Steps 15–18 completed successfully ✅
```
Output File
src/data/predictions.csv

## Step 4 — Run the R Docker Container
Build the image
```text
docker build -t titanic-r -f src/r_app/Dockerfile src/r_app
```
Run the container
```text
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/src/data:/app/src/data" titanic-r
```
Expected Output

```text
[INFO] Loading dataset...
✅ train.csv shape: 891 rows 12 cols
[TRAIN] Model trained successfully!
[METRICS] Training Accuracy:  0.8093
[METRICS] Validation Accuracy: 0.7472
[OUTPUT] Predictions saved to src/data/predictions_R.csv
[DONE] R steps 14–21 completed successfully ✅
```
Output File

src/data/predictions_R.csv

## Step 5 — Model Summary

Environment	Language	Algorithm	Accuracy (Train / Validation)	Output
Python	scikit-learn	Logistic Regression	~0.79 / ~0.78	predictions.csv
R	glm (caret)	Logistic Regression	~0.81 / ~0.75	predictions_R.csv

## Step 6 — Expected Results

After running both containers, two output files will be created:

src/data/predictions.csv

src/data/predictions_R.csv


Each contains predicted survival outcomes for all passengers in test.csv.
The scripts print informative progress messages (e.g., data cleaning, model training, accuracy, and output paths) directly to the terminal.
